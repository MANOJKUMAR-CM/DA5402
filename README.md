# DA5402
DA5402: Machine Learning Operations (2025)

## Course Objectives
* Understand the principles and challenges of MLOps.
* Apply best version control and collaboration practices in machine learning projects.
* Develop reproducible machine learning pipelines using tools like Git and DVC.
* Implement tracking methodologies using MLFlow to ensure reliability.
* Deploy machine learning models in various production environments.
* Monitor and evaluate model performance and make necessary adjustments.
* Scale data engineering workflows to handle large datasets and high traffic.
* Implement continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

## Prerequisites
* Knowledge of machine learning algorithms and techniques via DA5400 (FML) and DA5401 (DAL)
* Proficiency in Python programming language
* Familiarity with data preprocessing and feature engineering
* Basic understanding of software development principles
* Ability to use third-party libraries to build tools

## The Process
* We will meet every week during the Wednesday F & R slots
* There will be lectures every week to introduce you to the practical aspects of data pipelining, source control, experiment tracking, monitoring, visualization, packaging, and deployment of models
* There will be at least 10 assignments spread across the semester (60% weightage). The evaluation is based on the top-8 assignment scores.
* Each assignments will be given ~10 days for completion and submission 
* The end-semester exam will be a Data Challenge competition + Viva (20% weightage)
* There will be an end-to-end ML application implementation exercise where we will follow MLOps guidelines to design, implement & deploy for UAT (15%)
* Attendance and Class Activity Involvement (5%)
